The Atlanta Braves have invited former Georgia Bulldogs baseball player Kyle Farmer to spring training. Farmer is a nine-year MLB veteran and was a free agent. He will have an opportunity to try out for the Braves as a non-roster invite (NRI) in hopes of making their Opening Day roster.

Farmer most recently played with the Colorado Rookies. He is a versatile infield that can play third base, second base or shortstop. The 5-foot-11, 205-pound infielder could helped provide a boost in depth to the Braves, who are looking to return to the postseason after a disappointing 2025 season.

Farmer has 537 hits, 63 home runs and 285 RBIs in his MLB career. The former Georgia star has a .247 career batting average.

LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Dodgers designated reliever Anthony Banda for assignment on Friday after the left-hander won two consecutive World Series rings with the team.

The 32-year-old Banda had a 5-1 record with a 3.19 ERA in 71 games last season. He had an 8-3 record with a 3.14 ERA over two seasons.

Banda has been in the majors for parts of nine seasons with Arizona, Tampa Bay, the New York Mets, Pittsburgh, Toronto, the New York Yankees and Washington. He is a combined 15-9 with 4.44 ERA in 209 games.

The Dodgers claimed catcher Ben Rortvedt off waivers after he was designated for assignment by the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday.

The 28-year-old returns to the Dodgers, which he first joined on July 31 via a trade from Tampa Bay. Rortvedt played 18 games, hitting .224 with one home run and four RBI with Los Angeles. He helped the Dodgers’ starting rotation to an MLB-leading 2.17 ERA in September. He appeared in four playoff games last season.

Rortvedt had previous stints with Minnesota, the Yankees and Tampa Bay.

SAN FRANCISCO — The Seattle Seahawks didn’t get the respect they probably deserved over the course of what was a dominant regular season. Now that Super Bowl LX is here, after two great wins by Seattle in the playoffs, there might be an overcorrection.

Just about everyone seems to be picking the Seahawks to beat the New England Patriots in a Super Bowl LX rout. Go find anyone, outside of New England, who likes the Patriots to win straight up. Of the 10 oddsmakers Yahoo Sports’ Ben Fawkes asked, nine thought the Seahawks would win. Two-thirds of the bets at BetMGM are on the Seahawks to cover the 4.5-point spread. Around the host city early in the week, it was hard to find anyone who was taking the Patriots.

As we know, when everyone seems to be on one side, that can be dangerous.

While the respect for the Seahawks has spiked, the disrespect for the Patriots has gotten a bit out of control. Judging by the pre-Super Bowl chatter, you wouldn’t know they’re 17-3 counting playoffs.

Here’s why New England +4.5 is the pick for Super Bowl LX, with a reason to believe the moneyline at +190 is in play too:

The Patriots are excellent at the two most important positions: Somewhere along the line, it seems to be forgotten that the Patriots arguably had the best coach and the most valuable player in the NFL this season. Mike Vrabel will probably win NFL Coach of the Year, and while Drake Maye seems likely to finish second in the NFL MVP race, the quarterback who will win the award isn’t in this game. It’s not bad to take an elite coach/QB combo.

Mike Vrabel (and others) have experience: This is a matchup of two teams mostly new to the Super Bowl experience. Only nine players on both active rosters have been in a Super Bowl before.

One head coach has Super Bowl playing experience. Vrabel appeared in three Super Bowls. Listening to him speak about how he has laid out the week for his team, it’s clear he picked up lessons from Bill Belichick. Also, his offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has been a part of 10 Super Bowls. It might seem insignificant but the Patriots’ leadership being on this stage before matters.

The strength-of-schedule argument is overblown: Never before has strength of schedule come up so often for an NFL team. The Patriots had the easiest strength of schedule in the NFL, and that did factor into their success. But it’s not like they played in the Mid-American Conference. Winning 17 games against NFL competition is hard. While worth a mention, strength of schedule has dominated the conversation with New England recently, and that’s off base.

The Patriots can combat Seattle’s best player: Jaxon Smith-Njigba is likely to win NFL Offensive Player of the Year this week, and it’s deserved. So is all respect for Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez, one of the team’s best players who will likely see a lot of JSN on Sunday. Nobody should expect Gonzalez to shut out Smith-Njigba. But if he can limit him to some extent, that’s big. Smith-Njigba had 36.2% of Seattle’s targets in the regular season, which was the highest mark in the NFL. If Gonzalez can keep JSN from going off, Seattle’s offense doesn’t have many other counterpunches.

The Patriots match up well with Seattle’s weakness too: Seattle doesn’t have many weaknesses, but the interior of the offensive line is one. Guards Grey Zabel and Anthony Bradford ranked 44th and 72nd among all NFL guards in Pro Football Focus’ grades this season, and starting center Jalen Sundell was 19th. They’ll be blocking defensive tackles Milton Williams and Christian Barmore, who have been very good this postseason. That could be a big matchup, especially since Sam Darnold’s struggles come against pressure.

Sam Darnold still has turnover issues: The criticism of Darnold is overdone. He has been good for all but a few games the past two seasons. But it is worth noting that Darnold led all NFL quarterbacks with 20 turnovers this season (14 interceptions, six lost fumbles). Could a Patriots defense that has allowed 26 points in three postseason games get a turnover or two to turn the game? Perhaps.

As a bonus, here are some props for Super Bowl LX, with all odds from BetMGM:

Rashid Shaheed MVP (33-to-1): Here’s the thing: If the Patriots win the Super Bowl, Drake Maye is very, very likely to be the game’s MVP. At +230 odds, there’s no value in that. If the Seahawks win, it’s more wide open. If Sam Darnold doesn’t play great, Jaxon Smith-Njigba doesn’t go over 100 yards against Christian Gonzalez and Kenneth Walker III doesn’t have a big day against a good Patriots run defense, who could be MVP? It might be the explosive returner who can change the outcome with a big special teams touchdown, or a huge play at receiver too. The odds are enticing. I also love Shaheed over 19.5 receiving yards; that’s probably one catch for him.

Drake Maye first TD (+1600): The Patriots’ best offense this postseason might be Maye scrambling. Whether it’s a scramble or a designed run, Maye’s legs make him live to be the first scorer.

Hunter Henry anytime TD (+230): The Seahawks’ defense is fantastic, but they will give up some plays to tight ends. Henry led the Patriots with seven receiving touchdowns in the regular season. He has a shot to score in the Super Bowl and there’s value in the odds. I’m good with any Henry over props, like over 39.5 receiving yards.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba under 93.5 yards: This is a scary one. JSN was amazing this season. He could blow past 100 yards, of course. But Christian Gonzalez is pretty good too.

Coin toss is heads (-102): Last year, tails didn’t fail. With that win, tails leads 31-28 over heads in the Super Bowl coin toss history. This has to come back to the middle, right?

Last week: 1-1
