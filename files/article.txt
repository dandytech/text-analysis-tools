If You Invested $1000 in Apple a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now
How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.

Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.


What if you'd invested in Apple (AAPL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to AAPL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?

Apple's Business In-Depth
With that in mind, let's take a look at Apple's main business drivers.

Apple’s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone. The Services portfolio that includes revenues from cloud services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services now contributes a significant part of revenues.

The non-iPhone devices like Apple Watch and AirPods continue to gain traction. In fact, Apple dominates the Wearables and Hearables markets due to the growing adoption of Watch and AirPods. Solid uptake of Apple Watch has helped Apple strengthen its presence in the personal health monitoring space. 

Apple is expanding non-iPhone portfolio with the launch of Apple Vision Pro a spatial computer that blends digital content with the physical world.

Headquartered in Cupertino, CA, Apple also designs, manufactures and sells iPad, MacBook and HomePod. These devices are powered by software applications including iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems. 

Apple’s other services include subscription-based Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Arcade, new Apple TV app, Apple TV channels and Apple TV+, a new subscription service.

In fiscal 2025, Apple generated $416.16 billion in total revenues. The company’s flagship device iPhone accounted for 50.4% of total revenues. Services, Mac and iPad category contributed 26.2%, 8.1% and 6.7%, respectively. Wearables, Home and Accessories products category contributed 8.6%.

Apple primarily reports revenues on a geographic basis, namely the Americas (North & South America), Europe (European countries, India, Middle East and Africa), Greater China (China, Hong Kong & Taiwan), Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific (Australia & other Asian Countries).

In fiscal 2025, Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific accounted for 42.9%, 26.7%, 15.5%, 6.9% and 8.1% of total revenues, respectively.

Apple faces stiff competition from the likes of Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Google, Huawei and Motorola in the smartphone market. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer and Asus are its primary competitors in the PC market. Other notable competitors are Google & Amazon (smart speakers) and Fitbit & Xiaomi (wearables).

If You'd Invested $1,000 in Apple 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today

Once a cutting-edge growth stock, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has slowed considerably in recent years. If you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock five years ago, you'd now have $2,020, including the dividends you would have received.

An equal investment in the S&P 500 would've done about the same, totaling $2,010. Apple's return has more or less matched the stock market's over the last five years.

In part, this is because Apple was already one of the largest publicly traded companies five years ago, with a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Growth tends to slow as companies get bigger. You can still get reasonable returns from large-cap stocks, but if you're looking for explosive growth potential, you're more likely to find it by investing in mid-cap stocks and small-cap stocks. The trade-off is that investing in these companies often carries more risk.


However, Apple hasn't been as cutting-edge recently either. One of its most recent new products, the Apple Vision Pro, suffered from poor sales, according to analyst firm IDC. And while other tech companies have impressed with artificial intelligence (AI) developments, Apple Intelligence has had a slow rollout. Last month, Apple chose to power its AI models with Google Gemini.

Apple still looks to be in good shape thanks to its impressive product portfolio. It just reported record quarterly revenue of $143.8 billion in Q1 of its 2026 fiscal year, which ended Dec. 27, 2025. Well over half of that ($85.3 billion) came from iPhone sales.

Popular products and strong brand loyalty provide some degree of safety for Apple and its investors. It has a good chance of at least matching the market's returns over the next five years. But it will need more innovation, particularly in AI, to return to delivering outsize growth.

If you bought shares of Apple (AAPL) at the beginning of 2025, there’s both good and bad news. The good news is your investment turned a profit. The bad news is you would have turned a bigger profit by simply investing in an S&P 500 fund.

According to Barron’s, Apple’s stock returned almost 12% in 2025, which was below the S&P 500’s return for the year. What that shows is that while investors still have a fairly positive view of Apple, it hasn’t been an elite performer on Wall Street.

Apple's Services Business Was a Major Catalyst Last Year, and 2026 Will Likely Be Even Better
Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool

AAPL
+0.80%

Key Points
Apple's services business saw a record fiscal 2025 with double-digit growth.

Management said it expects services growth in fiscal Q1 to resemble fiscal 2025.

A new update from Apple on its services business highlights impressive data on the App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple TV.

Services is no longer just a supporting character inside Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). It has become a substantial portion of revenue and represents an even bigger share of profits -- and it's helping the company turn its massive device footprint into repeatable, higher-margin revenue. This, in turn, improves Apple's earnings potential and helps the tech company be less dependent on iPhone, which accounts for more than 50% of revenue.

Here's a closer look at Apple's strong momentum in services and how the important segment's momentum could accelerate in 2026.

Apple's services business is getting bigger
In Apple's fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 (ended Sept. 27), services revenue rose to $28.8 billion -- up 15% year over year and putting the segment's revenue at an all-time record quarterly record. The increase, Apple said in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call, was driven primarily by higher sales from advertising, the App Store, and cloud services. Zooming out to the entire fiscal year, the company reported services revenue of $109.2 billion, up 14% from fiscal 2024.

Including sales from the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Pay, AppleCare, and advertising, the segment ultimately represents how Apple earns money after a device is already in a customer's hands, making it a valuable business segment for Apple. In addition, the segment boasts a higher profit margin than Apple's hardware sales. In fiscal Q4, for instance, Apple's services gross margin was 75.3% -- compared to 36.2% for products. This recurring nature of the segment's revenue, combined with its outsize profitability, is why the services business is so important to the company and shareholders.


Services should shine in 2026
Notably, Apple management has strong expectations for the segment in fiscal 2026, too. Looking ahead to its first quarter of fiscal 2026, Apple chief financial officer Kevan Parekh said in the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call, "We expect services revenue to grow at a year-over-year rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2025." And given Apple's reputation for being conservative when it comes to guidance, I think this means that Apple could see an acceleration in its services revenue growth in fiscal 2026.

Key Points
Apple's iPhone and services segment could drive sustained sales growth for the company.

The tech giant will face some challenges, though, including potential tariffs.

Apple could deliver excellent returns through the next five years regardless.

10 stocks we like better than Apple ›

Considering the issues it has faced over the past year, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has performed pretty well, although it has lagged the S&P 500. However, there will be lingering issues moving forward. The tech giant might also pounce on some exciting opportunities. Which way will the stock move over the next five years? Let's see where Apple could be trading by 2031.


New iPhones will drive growth
Apple is currently in the middle of a robust renewal cycle. The company's latest iPhone, the 17, proved popular and should allow it to get back to double-digit, quarterly year-over-year top-line growth, based on management guidance. The iPhone 17 was a hit partly because of the added artificial intelligence (AI) features. This device might not be a growth driver through 2031, but by then, Apple will have launched newer versions of its flagship product.

The tech leader tends to keep things close to the vest, but according to some rumors, Apple is planning major AI overhauls for its next devices -- something that could improve performance and attract even more consumers. Apple's growing installed base will also allow it to boost revenue from its high-margin, faster-growing services segment. By 2031, services should make an even larger portion of revenue -- it was 39% of its latest period, up from 29% five years ago.


We could see services grabbing close to 50% of Apple's sales by 2031, which will have a meaningful impact on its profits and margins.

There will be challenges
Apple hasn't escaped the threat of tariffs, although the company has tried to appease the current administration by expanding its local manufacturing capacity. But the iPhone maker's reliance on manufacturing in Asia-Pacific, especially in China, could leave it vulnerable to tariffs. There could also be a potential impact from ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Apple. Regulators in the U.S. have accused the company of monopolizing the smartphone market, among other things.

Regardless of the merits of the accusations (that's for a judge to decide), investors should monitor the progress of these lawsuits. Unfavorable outcomes could affect the company's strategic position, financial results, and share price.


Is Apple stock a buy?
Apple remains one of the most valuable brands in the world and continues to grow its installed base, with over 2 billion active devices in circulation. And the company's latest success with the iPhone 17 shows that its most important product can still be a growth driver. Services should meaningfully move the needle, too. And despite the threats of tariffs -- which it has handled well -- and antitrust lawsuits, my view is that Apple is well positioned to deliver competitive returns over the next five years. The stock is currently priced at about $249.

How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.

Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.


What if you'd invested in Jabil (JBL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to JBL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?

How Investing In Apple in 1995 Could Have Made You Rich Today

Few consumer products companies are as beloved as Apple. Ever since the company went public 45 years ago on Dec. 12, 1980, it has built a cult following that has exploded into a global obsession. Currently the second-largest company in the S&P 500 stock index, Apple is a Wall Street darling as well. In fact, if you had invested $1,000 in the company just 30 years ago, you’d be a millionaire today.


Here’s a look at how investing in Apple back in 1995 could have made you rich — and the lessons you can learn from that enviable track record.

Humble Beginnings
Although Apple went public at a price of $22 per share, the company has split its stock five times since then. That means that Apple’s real, split-adjusted initial public offering (IPO) price was just $0.10 per share, per the company’s archives.

Although the company has had rabid followers since the beginning, it certainly endured its ups and downs. According to the Library of Congress research archives, the company began to lose market share in 1990, and by 1996, many analysts thought that Apple was finished. But in 1997, the famed Steve Jobs returned to Apple as interim CEO, and the company’s fortunes changed. In quick succession under Jobs, Apple introduced the iBook and the iPod and forged a software alliance with Microsoft. Soon, the company was off to the races again, eventually developing the iPhone, iPad, the Apple Watch and many other consumer-friendly products.

Long-Term Growth
According to Yahoo Finance, if you had bought one share of Apple on Dec. 1, 2025 — 30 years ago — you would have paid an adjusted price of $0.24 per share. If you bought 4,000 shares on that date, it would have cost you $960, just shy of $1,000.

Cut to Nov. 21, 2025, when Apple’s share price was $271.49. At this valuation, your 4,000 split-adjusted shares you bought 30 years ago would be worth $1,085,960. That’s an increase of over 113,000%.

If you had invested $10,000 instead of $1,000 back in 2025, the percentage gain would be the same, but your total net worth would have exploded. That initial $10,000 investment would be worth over $11 million today.


These results don’t factor in things like reinvested dividends, additional purchases or taxes. But the bottom line is that if you have the foresight to invest in Apple 30 years ago — a full 15 years after the company first went public — you’d still have unbelievable gains.

Lessons Learned
It’s important to note that while Apple was an obvious winner in hindsight, things were very different when the company went public in 1980 and even 15 years later in 1995.
